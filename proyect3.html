    My dad is a doctor and works at the IMSS, while my mom is an engineer and works in a maquila.
    My parents tend to be a little strict about certain things, like how I do in school,
    or the things I spend my time on, but other than that they are very loving and good to me.

            <li>Osito:He is the calmest and most intelligent of all.
            <li>Kiara:She is also very calm, because she is the oldest of them all.</li>
            <li>Monik:She is also quiet, but sometimes she is very naughty, because she has broken things.</li>
